# Chess
The above project is a chess game implemented in Python using Matplotlib as a GUI.

# Characters
The chess pieces are unicode characters for chess pieces displayed as a text on the board. ♔♕♖♗♘♙

# Board
The board is a mathematical plot with axes analogical to chess board axes. It is refreshed and replotted after every move.

# Movements
After clicking on the piece, if it is that piece's turn, a list of possible movements is displayed, marked with gray dots (for non-killing movements) or circles (for killing movements).
The game informs about a check, and a check-mate states of the game. There is a possibility to perform both a long and short castle.

# Score counting
The game has score counting displayed on the top of the board, together with a visual list of pieces killed for both players.

# Actions
The game can be reseted using the cross on the right side of the board. By clicking once on a pawn, the possible movements will be displayed for that pawn. By clicking twice on a pawn after selection, the selection will be reset. 

# Future improvements
The en passant movement is to be implemented in the future version of the game.
